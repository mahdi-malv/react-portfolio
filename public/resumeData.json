    "bio": "Since Highschool, I realized that I’m good at Computer stuff. So I spent even more time playing with and learning it. I really enjoyed working with computers and everything related to computer softwares. At the start of My University I started learning development of computer softwares. The starting point was Android. I learned Java and kept on developing android softwares. It’s been 4 years that I’m making Android softwares and SDKs professionally and it’s been a couple months that I’m focusing on Flutter frameworks for making my apps. Also keeping Android for SDK and library development. I also used automation tools and modern tesing mechanisms to help developing my apps and SDKs. Tools such as Gitlab-CI, Docker and ... I also never said No to other technologies and have tried frameworks like Django, NodeJs; Databases such as SQL, Mongo, Redis, etc. My Main task in the past 2 years was developing an Android SDK for pushe. The SDK uses Kotlin as language and integrates with FCM of Firebase for Push notification purposes. Also for testing and releasing, modern testing tools including Mockk and Robolectric are used. And ofcourse, this is not the end of my journey",
